 * 
 * Largest Palindrome as product of N-Digit numbers
 * 
 * A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindromic number made 
 * from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
 * 
 * Problem: Develop an algorithm, which will be able to calculate the largest palindromic number,
 * which is a product of two n-digit numbers. In order to achieve important optimisations, you can
 * assume that n is odd. 
 * 
 * 1) Implement reverse method. This method takes in an integer and returns its reverse representation
 * 	  reverse(12345) = 54321. You shouldn't convert the number into string and use String APIs.
 *  
 * 2) Implement the isPalindrome method.
 * 
 * 3) Look at the naive implementation of largestPalindromeThreeDigitNumberProduct method.
 * 	  This method calculates the largest palindrome number, which is a product of 3 digit numbers.
 * 
 * 4) Once you understand the largestPalindromeThreeDigitNumberProduct method, think of how you could
 * 	  generalise this approach so that it works for products of different number sizes.
 * 	  largestPalindromeNDigitProduct(3) should return largest palindrome which is a product of two, 3 digit numbers
 * 	  largestPalindromeNDigitProduct(5) should return largest palindrome which is a product of two, 5 digit numbers
 * 
 * 5) Optimise the method so that it runs in reasonable amount of time (~1s-2s) even for products of 7 digit numbers
 * 
 * 6) Test your code by providing additional tests in the NumberPalindromeTest class.
